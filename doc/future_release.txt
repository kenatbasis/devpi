devpi learns proper releasing
-------------------------------

The push operation is replaced by the more powerful and convenient
"release" command::

    # move the latest release and all its files to the upstream index
    # this operation will fail if there is more than one direct upstream
    devpi release name 

    # move the latest release and all its files to a specific upstream index
    devpi release name gti/dev

    # move a specific release to the upstream pypi index (effectively
    # moving it to the external pypi.python.org side)
    # this operation will fail if root/pypi is not an upstream index
    devpi release name==1.0 root/pypi

    # move the latest releases of name and name2 to main pypi
    # this operation will fail if root/pypi is not a base
    devpi release name name2 root/pypi

    # copy a release to an external index listed as "testrun" in your .pypirc
    # after this operation the release will remain present in the current index
    devpi release name [name2] pypirc:testrun

The release command will gather, verify and present the information,
asking interactively for "yes" before triggering any changes.

The release command helps to maintains an invariant within devpi
indexes: a release can only exist at most once in an index and its bases.
You cannot register a release at an index if one of its bases has the 
same version already.  Instead you need to increment the version of
the release.
