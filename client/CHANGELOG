1.2
-------------------------------

- "devpi list" and "devpi remove" now accept a pip/setuptools style
  requirement like "pkg>=1.0" instead of the former for limited "pkg-1.0".

- make devpi-client fully work with python3.3 and fix test bugs 

- use system http/s proxy settings from devpi-server.  fixes issue58.

- add "devpi test -c tox.ini package" to use a particular (external)
  tox.ini for running tox with the unpackaged package.
  also add "--fallback-ini tox.ini" option which will only 
  be used if the download package has no tox.ini.

- new "devpi use --set-cfg" option to set pip/easy_install configuration
  files when changing indexes.  Also new "devpi use --always-set-cfg=yes"
  option if you want to imply "--set-cfg" on future "devpi use" invocations
  and "devpi use --always-st-cfg=no" to disable this implication.

- support git and hg for exporting all versioned files of a directory 
  before performing the build step when uploading

- improve how upload works: setup.py is only used for building docs
  and release files but not for the remote upload part.  This gets rid of a 
  number of hacks that were done trying to get the Python shipped "distutils" 
  to pick the proper devpi index and allows proper SSL verification on Python2.6
  onwards.

- upload: show response when uploading documentation failed

- upload: allow to specify archive files as positional arguments (both files and
  directories can be specified but the latter additionally require
  a --upload-dirs option)

- fix issue54: upload now works on wheel files as well.
  As pkginfo does not support wheels directly, we use the ``twine``
  project which extends pkginfo for now.

- only show highest version in "devpi list PROJECT" output, unless
  "--all" is specified.

- on upload release files: skip rather than guess packages which contain no metadata

- strike BeautifulSoup dependency and re-use vendored pip-link parser

- use types/url/metadata/validation functionality of new depdency devpi_common 

- internal cleanup wrt pytest-flakes discoveries

- remove "archive" dependency in favour of a small implementation in
  devpi_common

- make devpi-client use a proper UserAgent string

1.1
-------------------------------

- detect "X-DEVPI-API-VERSION" header and check for compatibility.
  devpi-client currently supports version "1" and warns if
  no version is known (defaulting to "1").

- getjson now prints http reply headers if "-v|--verbose" was supplied.

- fix issue52: add "--no-vcs" option to force "devpi upload" to not
  vcs-export files before executing build/upload

- fix issue50: introduce "--toxargs" to "devpi test" invocations in
  order to add arbitrary arguments to tox.

- fix issue43: set PIP_PRE environment variable when executing
  "devpi install ..." so that the behaviour between 
  pip < 1.4 and >= 1.4 is normalized to always install 
  development versions.

- fix issue47: set PIP_USE_WHEEL with "devpi install ..." so that
  it will automatically pick up wheel files if pip>1.4 is used.

- fix issue42: allow to set empty bases for an index, so that it doesn't
  inherit anything.

- fix issue44: "use -l" doesn't break when a user has no index

- devpi test now invokes tox in-process (by importing tox) rather than
  a subprocess.

1.0
-------------------------------

- removed ``server`` subcommand and options for controling background devpi-server
  processes to become options of ``devpi-server`` itself.

- fix issue14: lookup "python" from PATH for upload/packaging activities instead of
  using "sys.executable" which comes from the interpreter executing the "devpi" script.
  This allows to alias "devpi" to come from a virtualenv which is separate from
  the one used to perform packaging.

- fix issue35: "devpi index" cleanly errors out if no index is
  specified or in use.

- remember authentication on a per-root basis and cleanup "devpi use"
  interactions.  This makes switching between multiple devpi instances
  more seemless.

- fix issue17: better reporting when "devpi use" does not operate on valid URL

- test result upload and access: 
  - "devpi test" invokes "tox --result-json ..." and uploads 
    the test result log to devpi-server.  
  - "devpi list [-f] PKG" shows test result information.

- add "uploadtrigger_jenkins" configuration option through "devpi
  index".

- fix issue19: devpi use now memorizes --venv setting properly. Thanks Laurent.

- fix issue16: show files from shadowed versions 

- initial wheel support: "devpi upload --format=bdist_wheel" now uploads
  a wheel format file to the index.  (XXX "devpi install" will trigger
  pip commands with option "--use-wheels".)

- fix issue15: docs will now be built via "setup.py build_sphinx" 
  using a internal build dir so that the upload succeeds if conf.py
  would otherwise specify a non-standard location.

- implement and refine "devpi push" command.  It now accepts
  two forms "user/name" for specifying an internal devpi index
  and "pypi:REPONAME" for specifying a repository which must be
  defined in a .pypirc file.
  
- remove spurious pdb.set_trace() in devpi install command when
  no pip can be found.

- show and allow to set "acl_upload" for uploading priviliges

- add longer descriptions to each sub command, shown with
  "devpi COMMAND -h".

- removed pytestplugin support for now (pytest reporting directly to
  devpi-server)

0.9.4
-------------------------------

- fix uploading by adding setup.py's dir to sys.path:  setup.py 
  files that import modules/packages for obtaining versions etc.
  now work. Thanks jbasko.

- fix automatic devpi-server startup on python26/windows 

0.9.3
-------------------------------

- new "devpi list" command to show projects of the in-use index or all
  release files of a project with "devpi list PROJECTNAME".

- new "devpi remove" command to remove releases from the current index,
  including any contained release files

- added "argcomplete" support for tab completion on options
  (thanks to Anthon van der Neut)

0.9.2
-------------------------------

- introduce "devpi upload --from-dir" for uploading archives in bulk
  mode, thanks to Anthon van der Neut for helping with this!
  (resolved issue5)

- improve automatic server handling via "devpi use"

- for "devpi server" you now need to specify "--log" to see log lines

- make "devpi use" also show base indexes by default

- fix issue4: auto-server data stored in non-dot dir

- renamed some --longoptions to --long-options
  (thanks @hynek and others for pushing)

0.9.1
-------------------------------

- refined "python setup.py" calls from ``devpi upload`` with proper
  ``__file__`` attributes.  Thanks Andi Albrecht.

- implemented new "devpi push" command for pushing out releases

- improved error handling for devpi upload

- fix logoff if not logged in

- don't use --force-reinstall when using pip

0.9 initial release
-------------------------------
